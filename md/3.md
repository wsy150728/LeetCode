#Question:
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:

    Input: "abcabcbb"
    Output: 3 
    Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
Example 2:

    Input: "bbbbb"
    Output: 1
    Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

    Input: "pwwkew"
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
    Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
             
#Answer：

````
class Solution {
    function lengthOfLongestSubstring($s) {
        if(!$s){
            return 0;
        }
        $count = 1;
        $queue = [];
        $length =strlen($s);
        for($i = 0; $i <= $length - 1; $i++){
			if(($place = array_search($s[$i], $queue)) !== false){
				$count = count($queue) > $count ? count($queue) : $count;
				$queue = array_slice($queue,$place+1);
			}
			$queue[] = $s[$i];
		}
		$count = count($queue) > $count ? count($queue) : $count;
		
        return $count;
    }
}
